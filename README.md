# puts "Hello World!"

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer, currently I support new developers enrolled in the Ruby on Rails developer program at BrightCoders. I help them when they're stuck in their daily activities.

Currently I'm looking for my first position as a backend developer, mainly with Ruby on Rails. 
Since I finished the Ruby on Rails developer bootcamp in 2021 at BrightCoders, I'v been increased my skills for backend and frontend.

I'm developing some practical projects to boost my profile using technologies like Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Hotwire, Sidekiq, Rspec, HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, Git, Github.

Currently I'm learning new technologies like React, AWS and MongoDB

- My main languages are **Ruby and Ruby on Rails**, **C**, and **PHP**.
